2023-01-12: Task Two: Cornell Box
=============================================================

![Cornell Box](2023-01-12__002_Cornell_Box.jpg)

A semi-accurate model of the cornell box, modeled using seven cube objects.

A
relatively simple task, the most difficult thing was figuring out the coordinate
system, and shifting and transforming the cubes to fit together (for instance
the back wall is a seperate object as it has slightly smaller dimensions than
the other walls to account for their thickness of 0.02 units)


2023-01-12: Task One: White Box Transformed
=============================================================
![Simple white box rotated about the y axis](2023-01-12__001_Simple_white_box_rotated_about_the_y_axis.jpg)

A simple white box offset vertically negatively by two units, and rotated fourty
five degrees about the y axis.
