2023-01-17: Task four: Getting There
=============================================================
![Made some progress, the blueprint for the task is there](2023-01-17__000_Made_some_progress_the_blueprint_for_the_task_is_there.jpg)

We're generating our Cube wave successfully and each individual cube cannot be
disconnected from the cube
behind it. All we have to do now is let it look at
all 4 cubes around it to determine what height it can be.

We essentially want
to cap the height of each cube to be within the range to touch all 4 cube faces
to other cubes. This 
will probably just involve some conditional statements to
catch boundry cases, but that should be fine.



2023-01-17: Task Three: Final Touches
=============================================================

I've moved the method for generating the scene file for task three out of App.cpp and into its own source file, this
is in preperation for task four in which I'll also be using this method to generate a scene file. (Doing so multiple
times in App.cpp not only seems incorrect and not generalisable, but would also make the file unreasonably long
for what it does)



2023-01-14: Task Three: Spiral Staircase
=============================================================

![Fixed the values so that the staircase builds correctly](2023-01-14__002_Fixed_the_values_so_that_the_staircase_builds_correctly.jpg)

The approach was correct but the numbers were off. 

I could not find the mathematical theory behind building such a spiral so I referred to Ilias
Kapouranis' project for reference, and he seems to have found some ratio that
works.


2023-01-13: Progress on Task Three: Spiral Staircase
=============================================================

![All the building blocks are there, but I'm having some trouble with the 3d geometry of constructing a spiral staircase](2023-01-13__000_All_the_building_blocks_are_there_but_I_m_having_some_trouble_with_the_3d_geometry_of_constructing_a_spiral_staircase.jpg)

We've generated a scene file, filled it with textured "stair" cubes and even
rotated them in a spiral fashion, but these cubes rotate around their center and
obviously this results in a janky jenga block tower as seen above.

Will need to
do some research on how to either rotate models not around their centre, or how
to offset each block by some amount in the x,z coordinates (I'm sure there's a
formula for it)
The tools are all there, though. Should be a simple fix once we
figure it out.


2023-01-12: Task Two: Cornell Box
=============================================================

![Cornell Box](2023-01-12__002_Cornell_Box.jpg)

A semi-accurate model of the cornell box, modeled using seven cube objects.

A
relatively simple task, the most difficult thing was figuring out the coordinate
system, and shifting and transforming the cubes to fit together (for instance
the back wall is a seperate object as it has slightly smaller dimensions than
the other walls to account for their thickness of 0.02 units)


2023-01-12: Task One: White Box Transformed
=============================================================
![Simple white box rotated about the y axis](2023-01-12__001_Simple_white_box_rotated_about_the_y_axis.jpg)

A simple white box offset vertically negatively by two units, and rotated fourty
five degrees about the y axis.


2023-01-12: White Cube
