System Overview
===============================================================================
At this point our program is just app.cpp, which sets the specifications of our render and defines
some variables we're gonna need for the g3d rendering engine, and then overrides the g3d app class which
does things like build our scene file, start the graphics engine and load scenes.

The code we added to this was a target framerate logger to the OnInit() method, which logs
our framerate in our render in real time, and some a method build_file() which builds our
scene file for task 3 (which contains many identical cube objects with different locations in 3d space)
by accessing the G3D::TextOutput class which contains many helpful methods.

Process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My idea was to take the spiral stairs idea and build on it. Generate some sort of interesting
pattern or shape using a mathematical formula to position or color models. I was thinking a sort of
grid of cubes where the height is variable and normalised to the height of the cubes around it, but
with some level of random variance. This would result in likely an interesting wave shape.

We use the Cantor pairing function to map our i and j variables (the x and z coordinates of each cube) to a
unique integer (for object naming purposes, this is difficult to do in G3D as the writeNumber function inserts
a space after each write, which messes up the formatting)



Latex Equation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$ \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \left[ \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h} \right] $$
